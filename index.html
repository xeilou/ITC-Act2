        <h1>Adobong Sitaw</h1>
        
        <h2>_______________________________</h2>

        <p>Adobong Sitaw is a traditional Filipino dish known for its savory and tangy flavors. This flavorful dish features string beans (sitaw) sautéed in a rich blend of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and spices, creating a deliciously tender and slightly crunchy vegetable medley that perfectly complements steamed rice. Adobong Sitaw showcases the distinctive taste of Filipino adobo, a cooking style characterized by marinating and simmering ingredients in a savory sauce.</p>
        <p>Using pork in this recipe is optional. If you are one of our vegan friends, you can still enjoy this dish even when pork is not around. Pork was only included in this recipe to add a little meaty taste to it, since I am a certified carnivore – as you might have known by now.</p>
        <p>I like this healthy vegetable recipe not just by its nutritional value, making adobo out of string beans brings out this vegetable’s natural flavor which is often over powered by other vegetables and ingredients in dishes such as Pakbet Tagalog, Pakbet Ilocano, Kare Kare, and Sinigang na baboy.</p>
